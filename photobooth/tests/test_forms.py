# photobooth/tests/test_forms.py
"""
Test forms for photobooth app.
Note: Forms have been migrated to REST API endpoints as of the current architecture.
This file serves as a placeholder for any future form-based functionality.

The photobooth app currently uses:
- REST API endpoints for photo capture
- REST API endpoints for event joining
- Django admin forms for backend management
- Frontend uses JavaScript to interact with APIs

If forms are reintroduced in the future, this file can be expanded with
comprehensive form testing following Django best practices.
